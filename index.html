                           		SocioAI is an AI-powered platform that aims to address this problem by providing users with a powerful tool for knowledge discovery and sharing in a particular domain. Whether you're a researcher looking for the latest insights in your field, a student trying to understand a complex concept, or a practitioner seeking best practices and case studies, SocioAI can help you find the answers you need quickly and easily. 
								What sets SocioAI apart from other information platforms is its use of natural language processing (NLP) to understand and interpret user queries. This means that users can ask questions in plain language and receive relevant, accurate answers, even if they don't have a background in the domain. Additionally, SocioAI’s database of curated information is updated regularly by a team of domain experts, ensuring that the information provided is current and reliable.
								SINGIN/SIGNUP: There will be a sign-in and sign-up page which will be the first step or entrance gate from where any user needs to enter to use SocioAI and which help us to keep track of user's activity so the next time some question was asked by the user so AI can recommend all relevant result according to his/her previous search results, and this will also ensure data security among the user. 
								Types of the User: There will be three different types of users in this project as follows:
 								1. Normal User: This type of user will be only able to ask their doubts and queries related to a particular domain. 
								2. Pro User: This type of user apart from asking doubts can also update any information after getting the request approved by the Admin.
 								3. Admin: Their will be an Admin which can manage the portal at the backend and can ensure that other users are happy with SocioAI and can take any relevant action.
								Database used: Database will be used to store information about user and types of queries and there corresponding solutions.
 								1. Normal User database: Attributes like user id, name, password, phone number, query pointer (for recommending most searched user query). 
								2. Pro User database: Normal user attributes and additional attributes to alter query, alter solution, query type
								3. Admin database: Admin id, Admin password, alter query from pro user, alter solution from pro user, alter query type id, alter solution type id.
 								4. Query type database: Query id, query name, solution id, global query pointer (for recommending most searched global query)
